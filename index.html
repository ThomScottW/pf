        <h3>Thomas Scott</h3>
        <h4>UCLA '24, Computer Science Student, AI/ML Researcher</h4>
        <p>Computer Science Master's Student at UCLA</p>
        <p>
          I am a graduate student at UCLA expecting to graduate in spring 2024.
          My interests include software development, computer vision, NLP, and
          machine learning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="bio-row">
        <p>
          I completed my bachelors of computer science at UCI in 2022. I focused
          on the AI/ML classes and did ML research in astronomy.

        <p>
          My hobbies include powerlifting, hanging out with my girlfriend /
          friends, playing video games, and working on personal projects. At
          some point I want to do more mountainbiking.

          <img src="python.png" alt="python" />
          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>4 years</span> of experience with Python. I have used
            it extensively throughout all of my undergraduate coursework at UCI.
            This includes working with data structures and algorithms, building
            search engines (also using Flask), and machine learning. For machine
            learning, I used jupyter notebooks and libaries such as sklearn,
            matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, and pandas.

          <h2>C++</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>3 years</span> of experience with C++. I used it
            extensively from year 2 onwards in my undergraduate coursework at
            UCI for implementing data structures such as AVL trees, heaps, and
            hashmaps. While learning how to use C++, I also learned how to use
            ubuntu virtual machines for developing in C++, which also taught me
            how to write bash scripts.

          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>2.5 years</span> of experience with machine learning. I
            have used various machine learning algorithms such as random
            forests, gradient boost, adaboost, stacked classifiers, and neural
            networks. All my ML programming is done using jupyter notebooks, and
            some common libraries I use are sklearn, tensorflow, pandas, and
            numpy.

          <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>1.5 years</span> of experience with computer vision. I
            took 2 classes at UCI, where I learned about camera transformations,
            constructing panoramas, using dynamic programming for seam carving,
            creating 3D models of real-world objects, and much more. I hope to
            further explore this area and even use machine learning to create
            interesting computer vision projects.

          <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
          <p>
            Using HTML and CSS, I have made the front end for a search engine
            project in an information retrieval class. It resembled google's
            front page, and accepted user queries and displayed search results
            in order of relevance. I also made this webpage, which I will
            continue to add to as I learn more about web development.
