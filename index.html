        <h3>Thomas Scott</h3>
        <h4>UCLA '24, Computer Science Student, AI/ML Researcher</h4>
        <p>Computer Science Master's Student at UCLA</p>
        <p>
          I am a graduate student at UCLA expecting to graduate in spring 2024.
          My interests include software development, computer vision, NLP, and
          machine learning.

      <div class="bio-row">
        <p>
          I completed my bachelors of computer science at UCI in 2022. I focused
          on the AI/ML classes and did ML research in astronomy.

          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>4 years</span> experience with Python. I have used it
            extensively throughout all of my undergraduate coursework at UCI.
            This includes working with data structures and algorithms, building
            search engines (also using Flask), and machine learning. For machine
            learning, I used jupyter notebooks and libaries such as sklearn, matplotlib,
            keras, tensorflow, and pandas.

          <h2>C++</h2>
          <p>
            I have <span>3 years</span> experience with C++. I used it
            extensively from year 2 onwards in my undergraduate coursework at
            UCI for implementing data structures such as AVL trees, heaps, and
            hashmaps. While learning how to use C++, I also learned how to use
            ubuntu virtual machines for developing in C++, which also taught me
            how to write bash scripts.
